## Overview
This project aims to reproduce findings and reaffirm conclusions from the paper *"High gamma activity distinguishes frontal cognitive control regions from adjacent cortical networks" (Cortex, 2023)*.\
\
In this paper the researchers aim to differentiate frontal cognitive control regions from adjacent cortical networks within the lateral frontal cortex by analyzing high gamma activity (70â€“250 Hz) during verbal tasks requiring attentional switching.\
The study employs ECOG recordings to observe these neural oscillations.

### Project Structure
_**Add when we finish**_

### Workflow / Pipeline
#### 1. Data Preprocessing (Previously Done)
- Signal preprocessing includes: re-referencing, down-sampling, and noise filtering.
- Bandpass filtering into 6 frequency bands:\
(delta: 1-4Hz theta: 4-8Hz, alpha: 8-12Hz, beta: 12-30Hz, low gamma: 30-70 Hz, high gamma (HG): 70-250Hz),
- Instantaneous power computed for each frequency band.

#### 2. Data Cleaning
- **For all trials:** Removing 1sec from the beginning and end of each task trials (since onset and offset markers were manually recorded).
- **For the hard trials:** Additional 3-second trimming from the beginning (to focus on the most demanding part of the tasks).  

#### 3. Computation of Task-Related Neural Changes
- Percentage of Signal Change (PSC) calculated for hard vs. easy conditions (easy vs. rest not analyzed).
- PSC used to identify electrodes that showed power modulations in response to increased cognitive demand.

#### 4. Statistical Analysis
<ins>Permutation testing:</ins>
- Power time series from all trials in each condition are concatenated into a loop, and trial markers are randomly shifted to generate surrogate datasets.
- 10,000 iterations (vs. 100,000 in the original study) to produce a null distribution to assess statistical significance.
- Performed separately for each electrode and frequency band.
- Computation time: 3.32 hours.

#### 5. Results Visualization
From the paper we have reproduced the following figures:

## To run the project follow this commands
All command should run under project root/working-directory
```bash 
#install Virtualenv is - a tool to set up your Python environments
pip install virtualenv
#create virtual environment (serve only this project):
python -m venv venv
#activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
+ (venv) should appear as prefix to all command (run next command just after activating venv)
#update venv's python package-installer (pip) to its latest version
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
#install projects packages (Everything needed to run the project)
pip install -e .
#install dev packages (Additional packages for linting, testing and other developer tools)
pip install -e .[dev]
```
